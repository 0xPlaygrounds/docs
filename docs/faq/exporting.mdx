Once you've done your work with `subgrounds`, it might be time to export your CSV to another platform. This is simply handled by pandas via pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.



## Example

In this example, we'll export some curve data for further analysis.

```python copy
# Gathering some daily snapshots from the aave-v2 subgraph
from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()
aave_v2 = sg.load_subgraph(
    "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/aave-v2-ethereum")

df = sg.query_df(aave_v2.Query.marketDailySnapshots(first=1000))
df.head()  # show the first 5 rows
```

```python copy
# "Save this data into a CSV (won't be available through the docs)"
df.to_csv("my_data.csv")
```

<Callout type="default">
There are several other formats that can be exported described [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html).

</Callout>

You can also easily load CSV files back into a pandas.DataFrame.

```python copy
import pandas as pd

df2 = pd.read_csv("my_data.csv")
df2.head()
```
