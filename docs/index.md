# Subgrounds

A Pythonic data access layer for applications querying data from The Graph Network.

## Design goals
- **Simple**: Easy to use toplevel API
- **Automated**: Schema introspection and class generation, type checking and pagination is all handled automatically
- **Schema-Driven**: Queries are built with `FieldPaths` while transformations are defined with `SyntheticFields`, as opposed to raw GraphQL and transforming raw data
