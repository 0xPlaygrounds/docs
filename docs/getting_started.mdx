## Simple example

The following example grabs a subgraph for the Aave v2 protocol and queries the top 5 markets ordered by TVL (total value locked), selects their name and their TVL (in USD) and returns the data as a pandas `DataFrame`.

```python copy
>>> from subgrounds import Subgrounds
>>> 
>>> sg = Subgrounds()
>>> 
>>> # Load
>>> aave_v2 = sg.load_subgraph(
...     "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/aave-v2-ethereum")
>>> 
>>> # Construct the query
>>> latest = aave_v2.Query.markets(
...     orderBy=aave_v2.Market.totalValueLockedUSD,
...     orderDirection='desc',
...     first=5,
... )
>>> 
>>> # Return query to a dataframe
>>> sg.query_df([
...     latest.name,
...     latest.totalValueLockedUSD,
... ])
                  markets_name  markets_totalValueLockedUSD
