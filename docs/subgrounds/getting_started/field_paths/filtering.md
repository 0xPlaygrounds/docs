# Filtering

Filtering subgraphs in `subgrounds` is done via the `where` argument in {class}`~subgrounds.FieldPath`. Subgraph's GraphQL provides several options to filter based on nearly any field path.

The following list will contain examples of all of the ways to filter field paths.

{{ thebe-button }}

```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
:caption: We will be using curve as the base subgraph for the following examples

from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()

curve = sg.load_subgraph(
    "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/curve-finance-ethereum")

pool = curve.LiquidityPool  # shorthand for examples
```

```{note}
In some of the following examples, multiple conditions are stacked on top of each other. This would **not** result in any data being returned since the multiple conditions would likely conflict with each other.
```

## Matching Values

Using the `==` and `=!` operators in Python, matching exact or negated values on field paths is pretty straight forward:

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Relative Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where=[
        isSingleSided == False,
        # or
        isSingleSided != True,
    ]
)
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Raw Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where={
        "isSingleSided": False,
        # or
        "isSingleSided_not": False,
    }
)
```

## Comparisons

Filtering can also be based on standard comparison logic on any field path, such as "greater than", "less than", etc â€” generally more useful for numeric fields.

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Relative Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where=[
        pool.cumulativeVolumeUSD > 150000000,
        pool.cumulativeVolumeUSD >= 150000000,
        pool.cumulativeVolumeUSD < 150000000,
        pool.cumulativeVolumeUSD <= 150000000,
    ]
)
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Raw Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where={
        "cumulativeVolumeUSD_gt": 150000000,
        "cumulativeVolumeUSD_gte": 150000000,
        "cumulativeVolumeUSD_lt": 150000000,
        "cumulativeVolumeUSD_lte": 150000000,
    }
)
```

## Nested Filtering

Entities can have any layer of nestable objects which thereby are **also** filterable in the `where` clause:

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} Relative Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where=[
        pool.hourlySnapshots.hourlyVolumeUSD > 1000
    ]
)
```
::::
::::{tab-item} Raw Form
```{code-block} python
:class: thebe
:caption: "The trailing `_` prefix is needed in the GraphQL form since without it, GraphQL assumes you are matching the exact value!"

curve_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPools(
    where={
        "hourlySnapshots_": {"hourlyVolumeUSD_gt": 14720000}
    }
)
```
