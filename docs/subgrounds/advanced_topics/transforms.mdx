title: Transforms

The `subgrounds` leverages an internal transformation pipeline that allows us to manipulate the GraphQL AST alongside responses returned from the subgraph â€” serving as the backbone of [synthetic fields](transforms//subgrounds/getting_started/synthetic_fields). Currently, only a small percentage of the functionalty is exposed via our top-level API, but we are working on leverage this toolchain to it's fullest potential!
