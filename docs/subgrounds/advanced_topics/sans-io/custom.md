# Custom Client

Implementing your own `Subgrounds` client only requires you to subclass {class}`~subgrounds.client.SubgroundsBase`.

```{note}
You can also choose to subclass {class}`~subgrounds.Subgrounds` or {class}`~subgrounds.AsyncSubgrounds` as they contain a more natural interface to work with, especially for simply swapping the implementation of the http client.
```

```{eval_rst}
.. automodule:: subgrounds.client.base.SubgroundsBase
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```
