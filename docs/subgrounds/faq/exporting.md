# Exporting Data

Once you've done your work in `python`, it might be time to export your CSV to another platform. This can be simply handled by {mod}`pandas` via {func}`pandas.DataFrame.to_csv`.

{{ thebe_button }}

## Example

In this example, we'll export some curve data for further analysis.

```{code-block} python
:caption: Exporting a CSV of curve data
:class: thebe

from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()



```
