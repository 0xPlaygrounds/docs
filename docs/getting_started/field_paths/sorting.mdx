title: Sorting
---

Data can also be queried based on specific sort of a field path. This can be helpful if you want get data such as the top performing pools based on revenue, etc.



```python copy
# We will be using curve as the base subgraph for the following examples
from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()

curve = sg.load_subgraph(
    "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/curve-finance-ethereum")

pool = curve.LiquidtyPool  # shorthand for examples
snapshot = curve.DailySnapshot
```

## The Basics

To sort, we define the `orderBy` argument on a field path:

```python copy
# Sorting by performing pools by total cumulative revenue
sg.query_df(
    curve.Query.liquidityPool(orderBy=pool.cumulativeTotalRevenueUSD)
)
```

By default, the sorting method is ascending. We can change it to descending (providing us with the highest performing pools) via `orderDirection`:

```python copy
# Sorting by the top performing pools by total cumulative revenue
sg.query_df(
    curve.Query.liquidityPool(orderBy=pool.cumulativeTotalRevenueUSD, orderDirection="desc")
)
```

## Layered Sorting

Since nested fields can also have arguments, we can layer multiple sortings on top of each other:

```python copy
# Sorting the top 4 liquidity pools and the top 3 trading days
top_pools = curve.Query.liquidityPool(
    first=4,
    orderBy=pool.cumulativeTotalRevenueUSD,
    orderDirection="desc",
)

sg.query_df(
    top_pools.dailySnapshots(
        first=3,
        orderBy=snapshot.dailyVolumeUSD,
        orderDirection="desc",
    )
)
```

<Callout type="warning">
Adding more complexity to your query will lead to longer query times as the indexer has to perform multiple internal database queries to construct the data as you request. If you hit the natural timeout of 30s, you can try running the query again as the indexer will continue to process your query in the background, caching the value for future queries.

</Callout>

## Sorting by Nested Fields

We aren't just limited by sorting only on the top-level fields â€” we can sort *by* nested fields. This is different than layering since we are ordering the main list of rows based upon a nested value (usually within an object).

<Callout type="default">
Nested filtering usually only works at a maximum depth of **2** and may not work across older subgraphs.

```python copy
# "Sorting liquidity pools based upon the output token's last traded price."
sg.query_df(
    curve.Query.liquidityPool(
        orderBy=pool.outputToken.lastPriceUSD,
        orderDirection="desc",
    )
)
```
