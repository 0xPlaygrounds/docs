# The Basics



## Subgrounds

The `Subgrounds` class provides the top level API and most users will be using this class exclusively. This class is used to load (i.e.: introspect) GraphQL APIs (subgraph **or** vanilla GraphQL APIs) as well as execute querying operations. Moreover, this class is meant to be used as a singleton, i.e.: initialized once and reused throughout a project.

The code cell below demonstrates how to initialize your `Subgrounds` object and load a GraphQL API.

<Callout type="info">
Both `load_subgraph` and `load_api` result in similar structures except subgraphs provide better optics since there's more schema data to explore.

</Callout>

```python copy
# Loading Aave v2 and snapshot api sources
from subgrounds import Subgrounds

# Initialize Subgrounds
sg = Subgrounds()

# Load a subgraph using its API URL
aave_v2 = sg.load_subgraph(
    "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/aave-v2-ethereum")

# Load a vanilla GraphQL API using its API URL
snapshot = sg.load_api("https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql")
```

## Getting the Data

Once you load in your subgraphs (or vanilla APIs), you can start gathering data via `query`.

```python copy
# Gathering the names of the latest markets in Aave
sg.query([
    aave_v2.Query.markets.name
])
```

```python copy
# Gathering the titles and scores of the latest proposals from snapshot
sg.query([
    snapshot.Query.proposals.title,
    snapshot.Query.proposals.scores_total,
])
```
